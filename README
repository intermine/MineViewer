Perl Demonstration Web-Application
==================================

This project represents a Perl based web-application
which provides a limited front-end to an InterMine 
data-warehouse. It is intended to demonstrate the capacity to 
access genomic data stored remotely at an externally 
administered data-store, accessed through webservices, 
and then integrate this data with locally stored user
curated comments. 

Requirements
------------

* Perl
* SQLite (local data store)
* Dancer (web-framework)
* DBIx::Class (database ORM)
* Webservice::InterMine (webservice client)

Setting Up
----------

Install the Perl dependencies:

  perl Build.PL 
  ./Build install-deps

Set up the local database:

  sqlite3 data/usercomments.db < data/schema.sql

Set up your config file - see "environments/gmoddemo.yml" for example.

Running
-------

  perl bin/app.pl -e gmoddemo

This will start a webapp accessible at localhost:3000. Change the environment 
flag to change the settings.
